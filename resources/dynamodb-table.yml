Resources:
    NotesTable: ## Describing the resource called NotesTable
      Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
      Properties:
        TableName: ${self:custom.tableName} ## Generated dynamically in serverless.yml (${self:custom.stage}-notes)
        ## Defining attributes type of string
        AttributeDefinitions:
          - AttributeName: userId
            AttributeType: S
          - AttributeName: noteId
            AttributeType: S
        ## Specifying the attributes as primary key
        KeySchema:
          - AttributeName: userId
            KeyType: HASH
          - AttributeName: noteId
            KeyType: RANGE
        ## Set the capacity to auto-scale
        ### PAY_PER_REQUEST (On-Demand Capacity): for starting out, and workloads are not very predictable or stable
        ### Provisioned Capacity: cheaper when knowing exactly how much capacity is needed
        BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST
      ## To prevent accidentally deleting serverless resources (DynamoDB in this case)
      ### e.g with a typo in the resource name (NotesTable), the old table will be removed and a new one will be created in place
